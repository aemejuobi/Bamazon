# Bamazon

# This is a CLI app that utilizes a database to hold products that can be purchased.

# The app asks you the ID number of your desired product, and how many units you would like to buy.

# The way I set it up is when the user puts in the ID, the product name, department, price, and quantity in stock shows up so that they have all the info on that product

# When the user inputs how many units they want, the app searches the database to make sure there is enough in stock to meet the customer's needs. If not, then it logs "Insufficient funds!". But if there is enough, the app adds up the total cost and updates the database on the new quantity of that product in stock.
